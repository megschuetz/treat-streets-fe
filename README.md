## Abstract

- Treat Streets was created using GraphQL in the React.js framework. This Halloween themed application is meant to give trick-or-treaters and parents more information about participating homes in their area. The application allows users to view a map of houses in their area who are registered to be giving out candy for Halloween and to register their own house to be added to the map.  

## Deployed Link

- Check out our site [here.](https://treat-streets.vercel.app/)

## Technology Stack

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- GraphQL
- Cypress.io
- CircleCI
- Postman
- React.js
- React Router
- Cloudinary


## User Stories

- As a user I should be able to browse houses in my area to see who is giving out candy. 

- As a user I should be able to add a home to a treat street to let other users know my house will give out candy. 

- As a user I should be able to click houses on the map and see more details. 

## Reflections

### Wins
- Working with ReactMapBox to display and use the map
- Self-teaching and learning GraphQL as a team
- Making CSS responsive
- Working on a full stack team with our cohortmates from the BE program

### Challenges 
- Using CircleCI and Cypress testing with GraphQL (stubbing and intercepting became more difficult)
- Deploying our app (struggled to get MapBox to show at first)
- Event bubbling issue with popups on houses (solved with the help of a seasoned dev experienced in MapBox)

## Future Features

Some future features we’d like to add to this application are:

- Add the ability to make a route.

- Add candy rating and hearting/liking to houses.

- Add login functionality.

## Application Set-Up

1. Fork repository on GitHub.

2. `Git clone` the repository to your local machine.

4. `Cd` into the directory.

5. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install project dependencies.

6. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the application. 

7. Run `npm run cypress` in the terminal  to run cypress tests. 

8. When finished with the application, type `Control + C` in the terminal to stop running the application.
